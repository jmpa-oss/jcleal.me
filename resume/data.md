### Professional Experience

#### DevOps Engineer, [MYOB](https://myob.com.au)

Melbourne | September 2019 - Present

* Uplifted the CI/CD practices of the team by introducing centralized Docker image repositories, decreasing deploy times.
* Introduced automations to promote team hygiene, which contributed to reducing the number of orphaned pull requests & branches in GitHub per repository, a decrease in failing pipelines in Buildkite, reduced lead times, and a reduction in the overall cost for AWS accounts for the team.
* Contributed to the uplift of the centralized logging platform to allow for ingestion of PCI data, resulting in the decommission of Splunk, saving over USD $200K for the business.
* Designed and implemented a custom Slack app to streamline the existing incident management process, resulting in quicker response times for the incident management team, and a centralized way for teams to see incidents in the business.
* Managed Sumo Logic, New Relic, Datadog at an organizational level.
* Uplifted the centralized logging platform to support the Sumo Logic Credits Model, resulting in a reduction of the overall credits used, allowing teams to utilize the vendor more for the same cost.
* Lead the user management of New Relic, reducing from 350+ full users to <200 full users, resulting in the business not being overcharged for users outside the contractual paid seats.
* Assisted in the ISO 27001 audit, for three controls around logging, which contributed to the business achieving certification.
* Contributed to the creation of a spike for an alternative logging platform for the business using Loki, Grafana, & AWS EKS. If productionized, the business would have a logging platform that has no cost tied to ingestion, reducing the cost of logging overall.
* Travelled cross-office to assist presenting logging and tracing workshops to teams, resulting in an increase of the number of platforms and services using the centralized logging and tracing platforms over self-managed solutions.
* Mentored proteges via the Future Maker Academy, where one such protégé has since been promoted out of the program.

#### Associate DevOps Engineer, [MYOB](myob.com.au)

Melbourne | October 2017 - September 2019

* Assisted in the creation, documentation, and release of a managed CI/CD solution to over 200 AWS accounts, reducing the number of CI/CD platforms across the business to a single pane of glass. In addition, provided training, coaching, pairing, and workshops for teams onboarding to this solution, increasing overall adoption.
* Created SDKs in Go over the GitHub, Buildkite, VictorOps, and other internal REST + GraphQL APIs, as well as instrumenting these SDKs into CLIs, reducing the complexity and time for teams to retrieve data from these vendors and services.
* Worked with various developers across the business to uplift their CI/CD practices by incorporating Docker, replacing their existing CI/CD solution with our managed CI/CD solution, and driving adoption of various internal tools in the process.
* Created a custom Windows Buildkite Agent for teams looking for a managed CI/CD solution that couldn't use Linux based Buildkite Agents. This resulted in teams having a consistent approach for either Linux & Windows CI/CD workloads, reducing the complexity for Windows based teams to on-board to our managed CI/CD solution.
* Managed GitHub, Buildkite, and AWS at an organizational level.

#### Graduate Developer, [MYOB](myob.com.au)

Melbourne | January 2017 - October 2017

* Rotated to multiple teams across the business to learn about concepts like Agile practices, programming at an enterprise level, DevOps, CI/CD, and automation.
* Promoted early out of the graduate program, being the first promoted for the 2017 graduate intake.
